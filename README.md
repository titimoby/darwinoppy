# Darwin mini meets Poppy

This repository is my attempt to cross [Darwin Mini robot](http://support.robotis.com/en/product/darwin_mini.htm) with [Poppy software](https://docs.poppy-project.org/en/programming/) through [Roboticia Pixl4 board](http://www.roboticia.com/?page_id=224)

Under Software/tools you will find help to set and monitor your Darwin.
In that case, you will need to install python modules: [bottle](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/) and [pypot](https://github.com/poppy-project/pypot).
Follow their instructions to install as your environment needs.
My setup just involved:

> pip install bottle
> pip install pypot
